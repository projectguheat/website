                        The Ateneo de Zamboanga University (ADZU) was established as a parochial school by the 
                        Spanish Jesuits in 1912 and was first named Escuela Catolica. It was four years later 
                        that the school got its name as Ateneo de Zamboanga. It was declared a university by 
                        the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) on August 20, 2001. It was also one of the 
                        thirty higher education institutions in the country that were granted Fully Autonomous 
                        status. This status is a symbol of excellence and consistency in delivering good education, 
                        research and community involvement. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Located at the heart of the Zamboanga Peninsula with constituents of diverse cultural 
                        backgrounds, ADZU envisions peace, progress, solidarity, good governance and patriotic 
                        citizenship for Mindanao and Philippines as a whole.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Its mission is anchored on its slogan, “pro Deo et Patria”, which means for God and country.
                        It is committed in forming students to become leaders with Filpino, Catholic and Jesuit 
                        values who will dedicate themselves to serve God and their fellow countrymen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        ADZU offers basic, higher and professional education with its three separate campuses. 
                        The main campus, Fr. Eusebio Salvador, S. J. Campus, houses the undergraduate, graduate
                        and senior high school. The Fr. William H. Kreutz, S. J. Campus in Tumaga houses both the 
                        grade school and junior high school. The Lantaka Campus, which was previously a resort hotel,
                        was recently added for educational, religious and social involvement. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The university also strongly advocates research and social outreach. Research 
                        activities are handled by the University Research Office (URO) and supervised by the
                        University Research and Publication Council (URPC). Social development initiatives are 
                        coursed through the ADZU Social Development Council, which has an institute and three
                        centers: Ateneo Peace Institute (API), Center for Community Extension Services (CCES),
                        Social Awareness and Community Service Involvement (SACSI), and Ateneo Center for
                        Leadership and Governance (ACLG).

                        the modern, the artistic and the high-tech, as befits its role as one of the 
                        country’s centers of excellence in design and information technology. For example,
                        the Department of Trade and Industry inaugurated the first Fabrication Laboratory 
                        (FabLab) in Cebu last year under the UP Cebu’s College of Communication, Art and 
                        Design. The Fablab is a service facility established for UP Cebu’s Fine Arts program. 
                        It aims to give arts and design students, professionals, entrepreneurs, and the 
                        public access to advance prototyping, printing and related equipment, as well as 
                        training and workshop facilities.

                        to enrich the Philippine culture and arts, and leads in responding to the needs of
                        the nation and the global community for sustainable development and social

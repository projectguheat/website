                        <p>The Ateneo de Zamboanga University (ADZU) was established as a parochial school by the Spanish Jesuits in 1912 and was first named Escuela Catolica. It was four years later that the school got its name as Ateneo de Zamboanga. It was declared a university by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) on August 20, 2001. It was also one of the thirty higher education institutions in the country that were granted Fully Autonomous status. This status is a symbol of excellence and consistency in delivering good education, research and community involvement. 

                            <br><br>Located at the heart of the Zamboanga Peninsula with constituents of diverse cultural backgrounds, ADZU envisions peace, progress, solidarity, good governance and patriotic citizenship for Mindanao and Philippines as a whole.
                            
                            <br><br>Its mission is anchored on its slogan, “pro Deo et Patria”, which means for God and country. It is committed in forming students to become leaders with Filpino, Catholic and Jesuit values who will dedicate themselves to serve God and their fellow countrymen.
                            
                            <br><br>ADZU offers basic, higher and professional education with its three separate campuses. The main campus, Fr. Eusebio Salvador, S. J. Campus, houses the undergraduate, graduate and senior high school. The Fr. William H. Kreutz, S. J. Campus in Tumaga houses both the grade school and junior high school. The Lantaka Campus, which was previously a resort hotel, was recently added for educational, religious and social involvement. 
                            
                            <br><br>The university also strongly advocates research and social outreach. Research activities are handled by the University Research Office (URO) and supervised by the University Research and Publication Council (URPC). Social development initiatives are coursed through the ADZU Social Development Council, which has an institute and three centers: Ateneo Peace Institute (API), Center for Community Extension Services (CCES), Social Awareness and Community Service Involvement (SACSI), and Ateneo Center for Leadership and Governance (ACLG).

                        <p>The University of the Philippines Cebu (Cebuano: Unibersidad sa Pilipinas sa Sugbo) is the youngest constituent university of the University of the Philippines System situated in Cebu City, Cebu,Philippines. It was founded on May 3, 1918, ten years after the founding of UP in 1908.  It had undergone many name changes through a 100-year history from  Junior College of Liberal Arts in 1918 to Cebu College in UP in 1947, to the UP Graduate School in Cebu in 1963, to the UP Visayas Cebu College in 1987, to the UP Cebu College in 2010, and finally to University of the Philippines Cebu.
                            <br><br>With its history at its heart, UP’s youngest constituent unit has embraced the modern, the artistic and the high-tech, as befits its role as one of the country’s centers of excellence in design and information technology. For example, the Department of Trade and Industry inaugurated the first Fabrication Laboratory (FabLab) in Cebu last year under the UP Cebu’s College of Communication, Art and Design. The Fablab is a service facility established for UP Cebu’s Fine Arts program. It aims to give arts and design students, professionals, entrepreneurs, and the public access to advance prototyping, printing and related equipment, as well as training and workshop facilities.

                            <br><br>The UP Mindanao research and development programs are aligned with the directions of the UP System and that of the Philippines’ medium and long-term development plans. These directions are in the areas of science and technology. UP Mindanao is a recipient of various grants for the development of its science and technology capabilities. The most prominent set of grants at present is from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and Commission on Higher Education (CHED).
                            
                            <br><br>UP Mindanao has state-of-the-art laboratories and equipment which makes learning an exciting and fun-filled experience for students. The laboratory services are intended to also serve other higher educational institutions and constituencies in Mindanao and in the region.
                            
                            <br><br>UP Mindanao is located in Barangay Mintal, in a setting that is unique in the booming Davao City. It is surrounded by a landscape that is free of intrusive urban and commercial distractions. It envisions itself to be a “green university town” in the future, one that retains its natural environment and uses “green” technologies.

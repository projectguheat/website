                <p>

                a highland retreat in the Grand Cordillera in Northern Luzon, with pine trees, 
                crisp cold breezes and low verdant knolls and hillocks. Through the numerous decades 
                Baguio has morphed from what was once a grassy marshland into one of the cleanest and greenest, 
                most highly urbanized cities in the country. It has made its mark as a premiere tourist 
                destination in the Northern part of the Philippines with its cool climate, foggy hills,

                </p>

                <h3>Cebu City</h3> 
                <p>
                Cebu City is a highly urbanized city located in the middle of the eastern coast of the island province of Cebu,
                in the Central Visayas Region of the Philippines. It is the seat of the provincial government although the city 
                itself retains political independence from the provincial government. It comprises 80 barangays subdivided into 
                two congressional districts. Barangays closer to the coast are generally smaller, more densely populated, 
                and primarily residential or industrial while barangays towards the northwest are generally larger and less economically developed.
                </p>
                <p>
                A feature of Cebu City, which is common to many cities and municipalities in the province of Cebu,
                is that its administrative boundary encloses an area with a large variation in elevation, going from sea level in the small, 
                densely packed coastal barangays, to elevations of up to 900 meters above sea level towards the mountainous central spine of the island of Cebu. 
                These mountain barangays generally have much smaller population densities, and although the primary source of livelihood is agriculture, 
                the landscape at these higher elevations does not lend itself well to widespread cultivation.
                </p>
                <p>
                The city is host to many business process outsourcing companies and is an important hub of tourism, trade, and industry in the region.
                The Port of Cebu is the second largest port in the Philippines, and due to the city’s geographic location in the center of the country,
                it has become a gateway for travel in the Visayas and Mindanao.

                <h3>Zamboanga City</h3>
                <p>
                Mandaue City is situated in the eastern coastal plains of Cebu province located at 10 9’ 40.34” N, 123 5’ 28.16” E 
                with an average elevation of 16.8 meters above sea level. It has a land area of 3,487 hectares and is comprised of twenty-seven 
                barangays. It is categorized as a Highly Urbanized City (HUC) and recognised as the most industrialized city in Metro Cebu 
                (Castillo et. al, 2018). It is known as the focal point of manufacturing in the Philippines and is considered as the industrial
                hub in Cebu province hosting about 20,000 industrial and commercial establishments. Furthermore, the Mandaue local government unit 
                (LGU) plans that by 2020 “Mandaue will be the Home of High Value Manufacturing Serving the Global Market”. Despite being a highly
                industrialized city, the Mandaue LGU envisions Mandaue City as a green city in the future.
